While working at a desk, sometimes when our focus shifts to the subject of work, we inevitably lose our healthy upright sitting position. We slouch, drop our shoulders, bend our necks, and continue to work in this position for minutes without noticing.
This situation is extremely dangerous for the health of the spine. Because maintaining an upright sitting position;
• helps your muscles work well.
• prevents chronic pain.
• Increases lung capacity.
• Increases brain health.
• supports organ functions.
• prevents spinal cord pain.
Now that we understand how beneficial sitting upright is for our health, we also understand that we need to be more careful while working. However, there is a high probability of slouching again without realizing it. If we are lucky, a colleague warns us and we correct our sitting position. Otherwise, we may not notice until these areas hurt.
For those who have no one to warn, it's time to enjoy the benefits of image processing. Let's say we work at a desk and bend or twist our necks a lot. In that case, a system that takes our snapshots and calculates and alerts our sitting position seems like a good idea.
A script, based on OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries was prepared for this image-processing system. OpenCV is an open-source library widely used in image-processing applications. Mediapipe, on the other hand, is an open-source framework for machine learning solutions created by Google.
